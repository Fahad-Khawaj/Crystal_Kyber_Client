# Crystal_Kyber_Client

Kyber is a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm designed to secure communications in a world where quantum computers could break traditional encryption methods. Developed as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, Kyber ensures that data remains secure against the computational power of future quantum computers.

This repository contains the client-side implementation of the Kyber post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. The client side is responsible for initiating secure communications, generating public/private key pairs, and encrypting messages to be sent to the server.

# Purpose:
To securely generate and manage public/private key pairs.

The provided picture illustrates the interaction between the client-side and server-side implementations of Kyber. The client initiates the communication by generating key pairs and encrypting data, which is then securely transmitted to the server. The server receives the encrypted data, decrypts it, and processes the request, ensuring a secure end-to-end communication channel. This setup is designed to safeguard against potential threats posed by quantum computing advancements, ensuring long-term data security.
