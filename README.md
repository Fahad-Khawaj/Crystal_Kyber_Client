# Crystal_Kyber_Client

Kyber is a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm designed to secure communications in a world where quantum computers could break traditional encryption methods. Developed as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Project, Kyber ensures that data remains secure against the computational power of future quantum computers.

This repository contains the client-side implementation of the Kyber post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. The client side is responsible for initiating secure communications, generating public/private key pairs, and encrypting messages to be sent to the server.
